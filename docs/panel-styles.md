# Styles Panel

The Styles panel gives you full control over the visual appearance of every block. It exposes CSS styling properties organized into logical groups, supports a powerful positioning system, style presets, and dynamic binding to entity state.

It is located in the **right sidebar**, accessible via the **Styles** tab.

When no block is selected, the panel shows a placeholder message.

<!-- screenshot: panel-styles-overview — The styles panel showing a selected block with the style target selector, preset section, and several expanded property groups -->

## Style Targets

Many blocks have **sub-components** that can be styled independently. For example, the Entity State block has a "State value" and a "Unit" target — letting you apply different font sizes, colors, or effects to each part.

When a block has multiple style targets, a **target selector** appears at the top of the Styles panel:

<!-- screenshot: styles-target-selector — The style target selector showing options like "Block", "State value", and "Unit" -->

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Block** | The block's outer container — always available |
| **Custom targets** | Sub-component targets defined by the block type (e.g., "Track", "Thumb", "Value" for the Slider) |

Selecting a target highlights the corresponding element on the canvas with a dashed accent border, so you can see exactly which part you're styling.

See each block's documentation in the [Blocks Reference](panel-blocks.md) for a list of available style targets.

## Positioning

Every block can be in one of two layout modes: **Flow** or **Absolute**.

### Flow Positioning

**Flow** is the default mode. Blocks are positioned sequentially according to the parent's layout rules (flex direction, wrapping, etc.). You don't set explicit coordinates — the position is automatic.

### Absolute Positioning

**Absolute** mode lets you place a block at any position on the canvas. When you switch a block to absolute mode, you can drag it freely.

<!-- screenshot: styles-absolute-positioning — An absolute block on the canvas with position guides showing the anchor point, coordinate values, and the origin point -->

#### Anchor Points

The position is defined **relative to an anchor point** on the canvas. There are 9 anchor points:

```
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ top-left │ top-ctr  │ top-right│
├──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ mid-left │ mid-ctr  │ mid-right│
├──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ btm-left │ btm-ctr  │ btm-right│
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

The anchor determines the reference point from which the X/Y coordinates are measured.

#### Origin Points

The **origin point** determines which point on the *block itself* is aligned to the anchor. By default, the origin matches the anchor. For example:

- Anchor `top-left` + Origin `top-left` → The block's top-left corner is at the specified position
- Anchor `middle-center` + Origin `middle-center` → The block's center is at the specified position
- Anchor `bottom-right` + Origin `top-left` → The block's top-left corner is at the specified distance from the canvas bottom-right

#### Unit Systems

Position coordinates can use two unit systems:

| Unit | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **px** (pixels) | Fixed distance from the anchor point. The block stays at the exact pixel position regardless of canvas size. |
| **%** (percentage) | Relative distance as a percentage of the canvas dimensions. The block adapts proportionally when the canvas size changes. |

#### Practical Example

Consider a block that should always stay in the bottom-right corner of the card, with a small margin:

- **Anchor**: `bottom-right`
- **Origin**: `bottom-right`
- **Unit**: `%`
- **X**: `5` (5% from the right edge)
- **Y**: `5` (5% from the bottom edge)

This block will stay at 5% from the bottom-right corner regardless of the card's dimensions — making it truly responsive.

#### Position Guides

When you move or resize an absolute block, **visual guides** appear on the canvas showing:

- Lines from the anchor point to the block
- Coordinate values in the current unit system
- The anchor point indicator on the canvas edge

Position guides can be toggled on/off in the builder header.

## Style Presets

Style presets let you **save and reuse** sets of style configurations across blocks and cards.

<!-- screenshot: styles-preset-section — The preset section of the styles panel showing the preset selector dropdown and save/manage buttons -->

### Applying a Preset

Use the **preset selector** at the top of the Styles panel to apply a saved preset to the currently selected block and target. When a preset is applied, its style values are used as the base — you can then override individual properties on top.

### Saving a Preset

To save the current block's styles as a preset:

1. Configure the styles as desired
2. Click the **Save as Preset** button
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. The preset is saved and immediately available for other blocks

### Preset Inheritance

Presets can **extend** other presets, creating a hierarchy:

```
Base Theme (font, colors)
  └── Card Preset (background, border, padding)
        └── Header Preset (larger font, bold)
```

When a preset extends another, it inherits all its parent's values and can override specific ones. Changes to the parent preset automatically cascade down.

### Managing Presets

A preset manager dialog lets you view, edit, rename, and delete saved presets.

## Style Bindings

The binding system lets you **connect any style property to live entity data**. This is what makes Card Builder cards truly dynamic — colors, sizes, opacity, backgrounds, and any other property can change in real-time based on entity state.

<!-- screenshot: styles-binding-editor — The binding editor overlay showing a condition-based binding that changes background color based on entity state -->

### Opening the Binding Editor

Next to most style properties, a **binding button** (🔗) is available. Click it to open the binding editor overlay for that property.

### Entity Source

Every binding reads its input value from an **entity source**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Entity** | Which entity to read from. Defaults to the block's configured entity. Can be overridden with a specific entity ID. |
| **Slot** | Alternatively, use an entity slot as the source. |
| **Source** | What to read: `state` (the entity's main state) or a specific attribute name. |

### Binding Modes

There are **5 binding modes** that determine how the entity value is transformed into a style value:

#### Direct

Uses the entity value directly, optionally with range mapping.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Input Range** | Optional min/max of the expected entity values |
| **Output Range** | Optional min/max of the desired output values |

**Example:** Map a light's brightness (0–255) to opacity (0–1):
- Input Range: `[0, 255]`
- Output Range: `[0, 1]`

#### Map

Maps specific entity state values to specific output values.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Map entries** | Key-value pairs: entity state → output value |

**Example:** Map entity state to colors:
- `on` → `#4CAF50` (green)
- `off` → `#9E9E9E` (gray)
- `unavailable` → `#F44336` (red)

#### Threshold

Uses numeric ranges to determine the output value.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Thresholds** | List of min/max ranges, each with an output value |

**Example:** Color-code a temperature sensor:
- 0–18°C → `#2196F3` (blue / cold)
- 18–24°C → `#4CAF50` (green / comfortable)
- 24–40°C → `#F44336` (red / hot)

#### Condition

Uses logical conditions with comparison operators. Conditions are evaluated in order — the first match wins.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conditions** | List of condition cases, each with rules and an output value |

Each condition rule supports:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `==` | Equal to |
| `!=` | Not equal to |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal |
| `<=` | Less than or equal |
| `contains` | String contains |
| `in` | Value is in list |

Condition rules can be combined with **AND** / **OR** logical operators, and can check multiple entities and attributes within the same binding.

**Example:** Show a red border when temperature is high AND humidity is above 70%:
- Condition: `AND`
  - `sensor.temperature` state `>` 30
  - `sensor.humidity` state `>` 70
- Value: `2px solid red`

#### Template

Uses a template string with `{{ }}` placeholders to construct the output value.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Template** | A string with placeholders that reference entity values |

**Example:** Dynamic background gradient:
- Template: `linear-gradient(to right, hsl({{ state }}, 80%, 50%), transparent)`

### Default Value

All binding modes support a **default value** — the value used when the entity is unavailable or the binding cannot be resolved.
