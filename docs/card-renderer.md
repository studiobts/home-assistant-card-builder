# Card Renderer – Using Cards in Dashboards

Once you've designed a card in the builder, the **Card Renderer** is how you bring it to life in your Home Assistant dashboards. It's a custom Lovelace card that loads and renders your Card Builder designs with live entity data and full interactivity.

## Adding a Card to a Dashboard

1. Open your Home Assistant dashboard in edit mode
2. Click **Add Card**
3. Search for **"Card Builder Card"** (or find it under custom cards)
4. The card editor will appear

## Card Editor

The card editor lets you select which Card Builder card to render and configure its entity and action slots.

### Card Selection

At the top, a **dropdown selector** lists all your Card Builder cards by name. Select the card you want to render.

If no cards are available, a warning message is shown with a link to create one.

### Entity Slots Configuration

Below the card selector, if the selected card has **entity slots** defined, they appear as a list of entity pickers:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Slot Name** | The name you gave the slot in the builder |
| **Slot Description** | Optional description of what the slot is for |
| **Entity Picker** | Select the Home Assistant entity to use for this slot |

Each entity slot shows its name, description, and an entity picker. If the slot has a domain filter, the picker only shows entities from those domains.

**Example:**

Your "Room Status" card has two entity slots:
- **Temperature Sensor** → Pick `sensor.living_room_temperature`
- **Humidity Sensor** → Pick `sensor.living_room_humidity`

### Action Slots Configuration

If the card has **action slots** defined, they also appear as configurable rows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Slot Name** | The action slot name |
| **Trigger** | The trigger type (Tap, Double Tap, Hold) — read-only, defined in the builder |
| **Action** | The action configuration — can be overridden per card instance |

This allows each card instance to perform different actions. For example, the same card template can toggle different lights in different rooms.

## Runtime Behavior

Once configured, the Card Renderer:

### Live Entity Data

All entity blocks display **real-time data** from the entities configured through slots or fixed bindings. State changes are reflected immediately — no refresh needed.

### Style Bindings

**Dynamic style bindings** are evaluated live. If you set a background color to change based on temperature, it updates in real-time as the sensor value changes.

### Actions

**Block actions** are fully active. Tapping, double-tapping, or holding blocks triggers the configured actions (toggle, call service, navigate, etc.).

### Automatic Updates

When you **edit and save** a card in the builder, all dashboard instances using that card **update automatically**. The Card Renderer subscribes to card data changes and reloads the configuration when it detects an update.

This means you can:
1. Notice a design issue on your dashboard
2. Open Card Builder and fix it
3. Save — the dashboard card updates immediately, no reconfiguration needed

## Card Configuration Reference

The Card Renderer card uses the following YAML configuration (auto-generated by the visual editor):

```yaml
type: custom:card-builder-renderer-card
card_id: <your-card-id>
slot_entities:
  sensor_slot: sensor.living_room_temperature
  humidity_slot: sensor.living_room_humidity
slot_actions:
  toggle_action:
    action: toggle
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `type` | Always `custom:card-builder-renderer-card` |
| `card_id` | The ID of the Card Builder card to render |
| `slot_entities` | Map of slot IDs to entity IDs |
| `slot_actions` | Map of action slot IDs to action configurations |

> **Note:** You typically don't need to edit YAML manually — the visual card editor handles everything.

## Multiple Instances

A single Card Builder card can be used **multiple times** across your dashboards. Each instance has its own slot configuration, allowing:

- The same "Room Card" template to show data for living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.
- Different action configurations per room
- A shared design that updates everywhere when modified in the builder

This is the core value proposition of the slot system — **design once, use everywhere**.
