## Features

### Advanced Drag-and-Drop Builder
Build your interface visually. Move blocks around with a fluid drag-and-drop system and organize your layout exactly as you imagined it.

### Modular Block System

The card is composed of individual blocks that can be nested, moved, and customized to create anything from simple status cards to complex control centers.

### Dedicated Configuration Panels

**Properties Panel**: Edit the core data and behavior of each block.
**Styles Panel**: Full control over the look and feel, including colors, spacing, borders, and more.

## Dynamic State Binding
Go beyond static values. Both properties and styles can be dynamically bound to the state of your Home Assistant entities. 

Want a block to turn red when a sensor exceeds a threshold or change its text based on an entity's state? It’s all possible through the binding engine.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations
Visual-only mode: At this stage, the builder is focused on data visualization.

Action blocks (buttons, toggles, scripts) are not yet implemented.

Interactions such as clicking to call services are currently unavailable.
